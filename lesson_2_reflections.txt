What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It maked a .git folder with metadata about changes in my working directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Thats the state where you added your files and they're waiting for commit

To commit changes in the staging area use:
git commit

Writing git diff without any id of commits you'd compare last file in staging are with the file in working directory

Writing git diff --staged you'd see differences beetwen your last commit and stage area

In order to delete all changes in stage area and working directory use command: git reset --hard.
Use it rarely, because it delate all the changes and you cant see them again, whereas you can see previous commits

BRANCHES
master - name given to the main branch
merging- combining two branches
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful, when i need to create another version, i experiment and so on

eIf you want to create a new branch to save this commit use -b with the checkout command
git checkout -b new_branch_name

MERGING FILES

*if you'd like to delete unreachable commits (without brench) use commnad: git gc

to connect to branches use command:
git merge branch2 branch3

to see changes beetwen commits, but not parent use
git show commit

Deleting a branch label:
git branch -d bramch_name

In order to see changes in nice way use command:
git log --graph --oneline
