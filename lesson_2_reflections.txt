What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It maked a .git folder with metadata about changes in my working directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Thats the state where you added your files and they're waiting for commit

To commit changes in the staging area use:
git commit
